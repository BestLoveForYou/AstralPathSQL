# Brief Introduction:
- This is a database system, completely based on java!
- The data structure used is a balanced binary tree.
- This data structure allows for efficient storage, insertion and deletion even with large amounts of data. 

# Usage
**Please do not use uppercase instructions!**

**Server**:   
**function:**   
Including select, insert, update and delete are supported!  

other function:   
**User authentication**:    
The format is username: password. User data can be added and deleted on the server or on the client that has passed user authentication
Example: user add root:123456, the default user is root:123456
**Underlying code**:    
getall - Get all data
status - Get the number of connections, status, etc
**Currently, functions are being developed:**   
Cache function, user permissions, and better optimization

**Client**:   
Enter IP and port number first, example: 127.0.0.1:9999
Then authenticate to use

# Config
The config of it (info.properties) include port , all_connect , and change_time   
You can change the config (such as the port) to change application's port .Warning: you need to close the program before changing the configuration file, otherwise it will be overwritten

# Update records

# v1.100 series
 ## 1.111.20220728
 - Fixed the problem of data update and deletion
 - Optimized creation of tables
 - Optimized binary tree engine
 
 ## 1.110.20220727
 - Optimize your search engine
 - Fixed the failure of binary tree search, the default form search does not use binary tree, only when the form attribute is set to "1", can use binary tree engine
 - Fixed an issue with incorrect encryption
 - Greatly accelerated binary tree engine speed, speed up at least ten times
 ## 1.106.20220717
 - Updated the new function of startup parameters!
